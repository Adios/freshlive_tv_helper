To write something more easily,

1. checkout the `gh-pages` branch,
2. [setup your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/),
    ```
    bundle --standalone
    ```
 
3. raise it up,
    ```
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ```

4. browse to http://localhost:4000/.
